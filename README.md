LÃ–VE folder with game and images, more updates coming soon

This is my first game in love2d, and impressively, it has about more than 210 lines of pure code. Using one single file - because I still do not not know how to use require() but asap I am going to learn about it - I created that simple game. yes, 210 lines. It could be compressed into shorter, but I let it long like is it now due to my organization touch in programming.
I hope you guys like it! It was a pretty cool experience. I used what I know from Roblox Studio and TIC-80.
